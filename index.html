<h1>Misael Galdamez </h1>
<body>
  <p>My name is Misael Galdamez and I'm following along with the 2018 Big Data, Visualization, and Society Class to try to learn some Python for Data Science. I'm a recent graduate of MIT's Master of City Planning, where I focused on inclusive economic development. I'm experienced in economic research, statistical analysis, and data visualization, and focused on designing novel means of achieving inclusive and equitable economic growth.</p>
